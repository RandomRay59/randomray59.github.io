  <h1>Anglesey Trip</h1>
      <p>Anglesey is a small island off the North-West coast of Wales renowned for being a lovely spot for seabirds, a tourism hotspot and, maybe less known for
      this bit, one of the safest places in the UK in the event of a Nuclear War. Apocalypses beside, it's a beautiful place that I had last been to many moons ago,
      so me and my mum decided to have a trip there again. Here are the pictures!</p>
  </div>
 <div class="container" style = "--containercolour: #a7b5b4;">
  <h1>The Plan:</h1>
      <p>We had booked a hotel in the pretty little village of Menai Bridge, in the South-East of the island. From there, we headed to the isle's opposite end,
      to a Nature Reserve called South Stack - famous in the UK for being a great spot for Puffins, Choughs, and other rarer coastal birds. Also on the trip,
      we travelled to the well-named Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, the seaside town of Beaumaris, we went through the forests of Pentraeth and
      Newborough, and finally ended the trip on the Eastern-most point of the island, Penmon Point (home to Puffin Island). It was a wonderful trip, and the weather was spectacular!</p>
