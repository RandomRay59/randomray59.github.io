# **Personal Website code (www.johnray.co.uk)**
This is the GitHub page for all of my personal website's code. It's taken me a rather long time to set up fully, and I'm constantly making changes to improve it. From July - September 2025, I 
started work on my other GitHub site, www.luastro.space, which eclipsed my work on this site. Now, however, I'm back to focusing on this one.

This site marks not only my first proper application of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, but is also my first use of GitHub to begin with. As a result, a decent bit of the code is likely flawed, or AI-assisted.
I aim to amend this over the coming months. One thing you may notice in particular is the large number of commits. This is because I was a little nervous, until recently, to use Push/Pull requests, and ended up 
just making commits on each individual page when I needed to make any universal changes. That's no longer the case, I'm happy to say!

Anyway, I hope you enjoy my website & my photos! Feel free to contact me via my site email at [me@johnray.co.uk](mailto:me@johnray.co.uk) if you have any queries or want to get in touch. Unless you're a scammer, 
in which case please stop emailing me, it's really annoying.
