  <h1>Lisbon Day Trip</h1>
      <p>Travelling abroad is a great experience that people usually take time with. They might stay on some Mediterranean Isle for a month
or so, relaxing on the beach, admiring the views, and taking their time before finally going back home. But where's the thrill? Where's the danger?
Where's the risk that if your phone runs out of battery you'll be stranded in a foreign country? I think that trips like that are a bit too boring.
Why not go to somewhere like that, say Lisbon for example, for a single day and have to cram in the sights in 10 hours with no suitcase, no hotel, and no backup.
That's what I did with some friends on the 5th Feb 2025, and it was considerably more fun (it maybe wouldn't have been if we got stuck there though)!</p>

  <h1>The Plan:</h1>
      <p>From Lancaster, we got a 2:40am coach to Manchester Airport (arriving at 4:30am) for the 6:45am flight to Lisbon.
We arrived at Lisbon at 9:30am and spent the day wandering around the Southern part of the city, before returning on a 8:10pm flight. We visited the Torre de Belém, the Jerónimos Monastery,
and paid a visit to the Capital's Botanical Garden and Cathedral. All in all, it was a pretty great trip, and considering we were only there for 10 hours we managed to fit quite a lot in!</p>
