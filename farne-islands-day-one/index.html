  <h1>Farne Islands (05/05/25)!</h1>
      <p>Considered one of the best birdwatching locations in Europe, let alone the UK, the Farne Islands are a small collection of islands off the Northumberland Coast; home to Puffins, Gannets, Guillemots, Seals, and much more.
      My good friend (and former LUAstro President) <a href="https://orlandopb.com">Orlando</a> told me that he was planning a trip there for birdwatching and asked if I would be up to join. As this was the day after my previous 
    trip to <a href="/yorktrip/">York for the Roses 2025 Sports Tournament</a> I was initially unsure, but changed my mind and came along - what a great decision!</p>
  </div>
 <div class="container" style = "--containercolour: #a9bdde;">
  <h1>The Plan:</h1>
      <p>We stayed at a permanent campsite an hour's walk from the town of Seahouses (the main town near the islands). We waited by the docks for a bit, before getting a ferry around the islands. It was a fantastic success, and we both got 
      the chance to take some excellent photography, and see some pretty rare seabirds. After the ferry, we went on a trip to some fields outside the town on the search for a very rare bird visitor to the UK - the Eurasian Dotterel.
      Amazingly, we both spotted it instantly (we expected it would take a while to find), and it was close enough for even my 300mm lens to get decent detail. After that we returned to the campsite for some tuna and potatoes, and planned what
      we'd do tomorrow...</p>
